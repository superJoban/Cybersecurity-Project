# Cybersecurity-Project

For our project, we decided to make a visual novel game. 
A Visual novel is an interactive story based game that presents fiction and non-fiction stories in creative and narrative styles with a variety of sounds and graphics involved in it, that helps in making the idea of the game more interesting, while keeping the players engaged. 
We have used Renâ€™py software to create the project.
The game aims in increasing the knowledge and awareness about password creation and protection, with an ultimate goal to provide knowledge about the password strengths and encryption to the players and the users.

This game was created using renpy (https://www.renpy.org/)
Renpy must be installed before running the game
